						<h1>Gourmand? Yes!
       		    Fan of scrolling through fancy recipes? Oh, definitely yes! 
				Fan of cooking though? Hmm, not so much.
				But, I am a young adult leaving abroad, so laziness cannot be an excuse for not cooking.
				A person needs to survice, and in order to survive, one needs to eat. 
				This is where my blog steps in. 
				For all the like-minded people as me, I offer healthy and quick breakfast, lunch and dinner recipes!
				So go ahead, go through all the deliciousness present at this website.</h1>
