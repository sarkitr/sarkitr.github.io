	    <p> Ingredients: 250 gr of chicken breasts, half an onion, bell pepper, & 1 pack of spinach.</p> 
	    <p> I am hoping that anyone reading this blog, already knows how to boil some pasta. That's the first step of this recipe.</p> 
	    <p>  The second step is to cut the onion, bell pepper and the chicken breast into smaller pieces.</p> 
		<p> After everything is cut, you can fry all of those ingredients for about 10-15 minutes at a medium heat and cover them with a lid.</p> 
	    <p>  After 15 minutes, add a whole pack of spinach, add spices, mix and fry for additional 5-7 minutes. Voila. The sauce is done. </p> 
	    <p> Serve the food in a plate and enjoy the meal!</p>
